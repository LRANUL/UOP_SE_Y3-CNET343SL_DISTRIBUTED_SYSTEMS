# UOP_SE_Y3-CNET343SL_DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEMS

## Coursework

#### Assignment Objective:
The objective of the assignment component of the Distributed Systems module is to
provide the students the opportunity to apply the theory and practical knowledge
gained during the course to develop and implement a distributed system. This will help
the students to enhance the individual skills of analysis, design, development,
implementation of distributed systems in a practical environment.
The assignment is a compulsory component of the module which accounts for 40% of
the module. Devoting a substantial amount of time for the project work consistently
throughout the session is highly recommended.
#### Project Selection
It is the responsibility of the student groups to identify a suitable project concept. The
project should comprise a substantial amount of individual and group work. The
following example systems will help the students to select a project concept but the
group may come up with their own concept.
- An Events Calendar service
- A Regional Weather reporting service
- Regional News collection and reporting
- A Property for Sale service

In order to support the academic aims of the assignment there are some rules intended
to ensure that the system is heterogeneous and that you employ suitable middleware.
The project selection should be based on and to support the academic goals of the
module. But you should also consider the realistic commercial requirements and value
of the selected project concept.

Guidelines
- The assignment is intended to complete as a group work, with some individual
evaluation as described in section 3 of the assessment criteria.
- The group must consist of at most five students. The details of the groups
(student id, name, email and contact number) must be communicated to the
NSBM program office with in the first five weeks after the commencement of
the module.
- After submitting the proposal, the team has to confirm with the supervisor the
scope and functionality of the system and receive formal approval prior to
starting the implementation work.
- The group report should clearly indicate the contribution of each individual
towards the project. All individuals are expected to have a complete
understanding on the total system not only the areas that they worked on.
- The group report should not contain more than 5000 words 
- **Managing Heterogeneity:** The distributed system must consist of at least three
devices communicating with each other. At least one device must be a PC or
virtual machine running on a PC. One other device must be a mobile networked
device. The mobile device, typically acting as a client, will be running an
embedded operating system such as Windows Mobile OS, Apple iOS or
Android. Other networked computers may include your own laptop.
- Your system should be robust and responsive, and tolerant to network failures.
- **Choosing Middleware:** You need to select a middleware in implementation
and the use of suitable middleware will attract marks. You must be able to justify
your choice of middleware in terms of the application architecture and
functionality.
- You are expected to make use of legally available software components, APIs,
templates, etc. However, YOU MUST DECLARE EVERYTHING YOU HAVE
USED in your report and explain how and why you have used them.
